I. INTRODUCTION
  A.Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications

II. PREPARE YOUR PAPER BEFORE STYLING
  -Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file.
  -Complete all content and organizational editing before formatting.
  -Do not number text heads---LATEX will do that for you.
  
  A.Abbreviations and Acronyms
    -Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.
  B.Units
    -Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units.
    -An exception for English units as identifiers in trade. Such as “3.5-inch disk drive”.
    -Avoid combining SI and CGS units.
    -If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
    -do not use “webers/m2” instead of “Wb/m2” or “webers per square meter”.
    -Spell out units when they appear in text: “. . . a few henries”, not “. . . a few H”.
    -Use a zero before decimal points: “0.25”, not “.25”.
  C.Equations
    -Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign.
    -Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence.
    -The equation number use "(1)", not "Eq. (1)".
  D.LATEX
    -Use “soft” (e.g., \eqref{Eq}) cross references instead of “hard” references (e.g., (1)).
    -Don’t use the {eqnarray}
    -Use {align} or {IEEEeqnarray}.
    -{subequations} environment in LATEX also increment the main equation counter.
    -If you assign the same label to a subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I   has been cross referenced as Table IV-B3.
    -Do not use \nonumber inside the {array} environment. It might stop a wanted equation number in the surrounding equation.
  E.Some Common Mistakes
    -The word “data” is plural, not singular.
    -µ0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter “o”.
    -When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface.
    -To highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks.
    -A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis.
